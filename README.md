# CSE-567-Computational-Linguistic
This is for the course project, unsupervised Chinese word segmentation.

## 1. Get the wiki index as our word dictionary.

For unsupervised methods, wiki is a good resource to acquire language resources.

## 2. In the "IterativeSegmentation/"

To get washed corpus, and certain percentages of the data, use:
```python
python get_80p_train_test.py
```

To run the segmentation:
```python
python IterativeSeg.py
```

However, the result is not good. May be improved.
